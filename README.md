# Sports Betting Arbitrage Notification System

## Overview

This project automates the detection of arbitrage opportunities in sports betting webpages from Australia by scraping data from various websites, analyzing it for profitable bets, and notifying users via a Discord webhook when such opportunities are found.
- The project is currently only focusing on AFL matches from a short list of sites, this results in it not being overly effective, although this is a WIP
- The sites include: Sportsbet, Ladbrokes, NAB.
